                   A chase ensues. Riley and Gangstalicious are caught when they run into a line of cars stopped at a red light on a one-way street. They are put into the trunk of the captors' car and driven away. While in the trunk, Gangstalicious tells them that when he was his age his favorite rapper was Ice Cube, to which Riley replies, "That guy who makes family movies? He was a gangsta rapper?" They are finally taken to a remote location, where Gangstalicious is stripped, bound, and blindfolded, in preparation for what appears to be a brutal gangland murder. However, the leader of the three men, Lincoln, approaches Gangstalicious and suddenly proclaims his love for him, kissing him passionately on the lips. "We could have had a life together, man!" he exclaimed. The three men then back up and open fire, emptying their magazines in his direction. However, every single one of the shots misses Gangstalicious, who then scurries away. Riley faints and later walks home, only to arrive to an irrate Robert, who isn't interested in Riley's "made up" story.
